# Student's Result Announcement App
This app is created as a take-home coding challenge by Pacer. The following tasks are requirements that are in the challenge, and these are my attempts to meet these requirements. 

The idea of this app is to simply display the results of students. A simple app like this is made in hopes to maintain simplicity and effectiveness of the answers.

## Task 1
`Create a simple Python Django app that has the following features:
- a backend API endpoint called get_score with a simple dummy formula that could
be anything e.g. result = input + 1
- a PostgreSQL database that the backend API uses to log the user ID and the score
- demonstrate that the endpoint is behaving as expected (how do we test it? how can
we prove that it is working as expected?)
`
